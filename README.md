# Reproducible Research in the Interpretive Social Sciences

The repository is a short example of what reproducible research may look like the interpretive social sciences. The goal with this reprository is to present a way of inviting readers to explore themes in interpretive or qualitative data. The output should be completely reproducible, providing a foundation to build reliable intepretation of the output.

The repository includes a [Binder badge](https://mybinder.org/) so readers can launch a working environment in their browser and directly execute code, without having to download software.

In this example I do not assume the reader knows how to code in Python. I provide clear markers to allow the reader to change the code to explore the output, without knowing exactly what the code does.
