# Reproducible Research in the Interpretive Social Sciences

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lknelson/reproducibility-example/master)


The repository is an example of what reproducible research may look like the interpretive social sciences. The goal with this reprository is to present a way of inviting readers to explore themes in interpretive or qualitative data. Unlike hand-coded data, the results from these analyses are completely reproducible, providing a foundation to build better understandings and intepretations of the phenomenon of interest.

The repository includes a [Binder badge](https://mybinder.org/) so readers can launch a working environment in their browser and directly execute code, without having to download software. The binder badge is the launch/binder icon at the top of this file.

In this example I do not assume the reader knows how to code in Python. Instead, I provide clear markers to allow the reader to change the code to explore the output and results.
